    description: Getting around Singapore is easy. The public transportation system is extremely easy to use and taxis are reasonably priced. All public transport systems in Singapore use the <a href="https://www.ezlink.com.sg/">EZ-link contactless RFID farecard</a> or a <a href="https://www.nets.com.sg/personal/transit-payments/nets-flashpay/">Nets Flash Pay card</a>. You can store value on it and use it on trains (MRT) and city buses. The card can be bought at MRT stations can be "topped up" in increments at the farecard vending machines or 7-Eleven stores. Taxis use meters and are reasonably priced and honest. Mobile apps like <a href="https://www.go-jek.com/sg/">Gojek</a> and <a href="https://www.grab.com/sg/taxi/">Grab</a> are handy in getting Taxis.
